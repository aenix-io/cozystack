                                    be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                    incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`

                                    for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                    pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                    The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.

                                        be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the

                                    be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                    incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key in (value)`

                                    pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                    The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                    Also, MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.

                                        MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                        be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                        to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                        for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                        pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                        The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                        Also, MismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                        This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                                        MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                        be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                        to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                        for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                        pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                        The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                        Also, MismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                        This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                                        MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                        be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                        to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                        for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                        pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                        The same key is forbidden to exist in both MismatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                        Also, MismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                        This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.
